      'Folktales have transcended through generations of human civilization as a testimony of not only its multifarious past but also of the inherent need of humans for storytelling. Humans are storytellers and more importantly listeners; probably the very reason why folktales have survived the onslaught of time. These folktales, rudimentary in its narrative structure, eclectic in its themes and unadorned with superfluous details or verbose literature, are mirrors to our obscure past providing us glimpses in to the minds of our ancestors.‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£',
      'First There Was a Woman brings to us the Folktales of the Dungri Garasiya Adivasis of the Bhil tribe native to Gujarat and Rajasthan. As the title may have suggested, they were initially a feminist community and their ancestors believed that women were at par with men in everything, be it physical or mental. Daughters were as much desired as sons. These folktales, thus, selected and narrated by the author, are mostly centred on women, nature and the traditional life and beliefs of the Dungri Garasiya adivasis.‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£'

      "I read The Bear and the Nightingale this March and it is hands down the best fiction (historical+fantasy+folklore) I have read in recent times. I can't wait to read the next two parts of the Winternight Trilogy. Sadly, I have the third part but not the second. Why? Because I want the hardcover edition which has been out of stock since January. üòì As both the other two books are hardcover I just couldn't convince myself to get the paperback edition of The Girl in the Tower.",
      "I wanted something totally different from the current one. This is one of the last photos of this theme and I don't think I am going to post the remaining one or two photos .It was hard work to figure out what I wanted to create! Phew! So yeah, new theme incoming. Also, a few changes here and there. "

      'A Curse So Dark and Lonely is a ‚ÄòBeauty and the Beast‚Äô retelling with a different spin and thank-god-not-so-perfect characters. The plot although predictable but keeps the reader engrossed. I liked how the narrative followed the POVs of the two central characters.‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£ ‚Å£ Harper suffers from cerebral palsy but she takes it in her stride. In fact, she is quite upfront about her disability and that is a great takeaway from her character.‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£',
      'What I did not like is the way the book ended. It is supposed to be a cliff hanger and make you desperate for its sequel. Unfortunately, although I am looking forward to reading the sequel but I am not desperate for it.‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£ Truth be told I never felt I would enjoy YA Fantasy genre (Harry Potter does not count!) but I did more than I anticipated! Everyone should read a feel good book once in a while and that is what this is: a feel good book'

      `Although the popular adage tells us 'Do not judge a book by its cover', let's not ignore the fact that a lot of hard work goes into designing a book cover. If you ever happen to observe a cover closely sometimes there are beautiful ùò•ùò¶ùòµùò¢ùò™ùò≠ùò¥ that deserves praise but goes by unnoticed.`,
      `‚Å£‚Å£Speaking of which, Crafting the Word has all the elements that make it stand out. Fr‚Å£om the aesthetically pleasing pastel shades to the illusrtations and the fonts used, this book is a feast to the eyes.‚Å£The illustrations depict the famous Ima Market ‚Å£of Manipur, a market run entirely by women, aptly potraying the essence of the book which is "A collection of women's writings that not only reflects the richness of Manipuri literature, but also fuses the idea of gender equality....".‚Å£‚Å£ Finally, a big shputout to everyone whose creativity and hard work brought to us this beautiful book.`

      'The book is laden with factual accounts and data with ample citations but that does not break the pace of the narrative nor does make it sound academic. It will take a few more readings to register so much information in my mind but I am willing to do that. The chapters of the book do not follow any particular chronology, nevertheless the episodic events are cohesively woven to bring forth to the reader a deeper perspective into the still ongoing political turmoil in the state.‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£',
